# Endorse-Skills by Selenium py
Initially, I present to you the humble tool for making Endorse for LinkedIn skills.
The tool requires you to enter the account information, the LinkedIn email, and the password.
And then we run the script and let him take care of everything.

```Note```
> 1. Linkedin may form in your account and ask to solve the caption code after logging in. Please solve it. It will not take seconds of your time.

> 2 . If there is a problem, I think it is on the Internet, so you can restart the script again.
